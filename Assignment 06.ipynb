    "## 2) OBJECT:\n",
    "### An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",
    "## 3) ATTRIBUTE:\n",
    "### An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) BEHAVIOR:\n",
    "### A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates for example, how it will react if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
